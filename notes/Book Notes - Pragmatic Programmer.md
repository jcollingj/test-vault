# The Pragmatic Programmer - Reading Notes

## Key Takeaways

### DRY Principle
- Don't Repeat Yourself
- Every piece of knowledge should have a single, authoritative representation
- Not just about code - applies to documentation, data, APIs

### Broken Windows Theory
- Don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, poor code) unrepaired
- Fix problems when you see them
- One broken window can lead to deterioration

### Tracer Bullets
- Build end-to-end skeleton first
- Get immediate feedback
- Adjust based on real results

### Good Enough Software
- Perfect is the enemy of good
- Ship when software is good enough
- Users can give feedback sooner
