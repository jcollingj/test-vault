## Tasks
- [x] Performance profiling
- [x] Review API documentation
- [ ] Implement caching layer
- [x] Team knowledge sharing session

## Performance Work
Profiled the application today:
- Identified slow database queries
- Found unnecessary re-renders in React
- Memory leaks in WebSocket connections

**Optimizations planned:**
1. Add database indexes
2. Implement React.memo strategically
3. Add Redis caching layer
4. Fix WebSocket cleanup

## Knowledge Sharing
Gave a tech talk on "React Performance Patterns"
- Covered memoization strategies
- Discussed when to optimize
- Shared profiling tools and techniques
- Got great questions from the team

## API Review
New v2 endpoints look solid:
- Good REST conventions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Well documented
- Need to update frontend integration

## Evening Learning
- Experimented with Bun's built-in testing
- Compared performance with Node.js
- Impressed by the speed improvements
