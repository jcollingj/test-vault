## Side Project Progress
- Continued work on SvelteKit task tracker
- Implemented:
  - Task CRUD operations
  - Local storage persistence
  - Drag and drop reordering
  - Filter by status

## Learning
- Deep dive into SvelteKit's routing system
- Learned about Svelte stores vs React state
- Much less boilerplate than React!

## Blog Post Draft
Started writing "Why I'm Exploring SvelteKit"
- Simplicity vs React complexity
- Performance benefits
- Developer experience
- When to use each

## Reflection
Really enjoying this balance of work and personal projects. The side project is teaching me things I can apply at work, and work problems inspire side project features.

## Prep for Monday
- Review demo slides
- Double-check staging environment
- Prepare for questions about architecture choices
